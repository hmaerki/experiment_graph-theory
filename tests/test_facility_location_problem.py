"""
The problem of deciding the exact place in a community where a school or a fire station should be located,
is classified as the facility location problem.

If the facility is a school, it is desirable to locate it so that the sum 
of distances travelled by all members of the communty is as short as possible. 
This is the minimum of sum - or in short `minsum` of the graph.

If the facility is a firestation, it is desirable to locate it so that the distance from the firestation
to the farthest point in the community is minimized. 
This is the minimum of max distances - or in short `minmax` of the graph.
